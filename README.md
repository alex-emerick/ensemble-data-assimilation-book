## About the Book

*Ensemble Data Assimilation Applied to Geological Reservoir Models* offers an in-depth examination of ensemble-based data assimilation methods for the numerical modeling of geological reservoirs. Grounded in a Bayesian framework, the book emphasizes the integration of prior geological knowledge with dynamic data to improve model predictions.

A central focus is on iterative ensemble smoothers, particularly the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA), which has demonstrated effectiveness in real-world applications. The methods are presented with a balance of theoretical rigor and practical insights, featuring pseudo-codes and case studies that bridge theory and practice.
